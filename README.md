# FreeD
Open source, public data campaign and election software

FreeD is a collection of tools for a free digital campaign management platform.
The purpose of FreeD as a software project is to encourage excellence in government operations around the globe.

FreeD provides:
   1. A system for operating ad-hoc social networks, in which small of groups (4-5) of individuals are formed for a brief (~3 days) conversation over chat / SMS / text. 
   2. A publicly visible accounting of the funds received and spent through the platform.
   3. A private and anonymous individual database for identity resolution.
   4. An API for media spend.

## Small group conversations
Campaigns and governments are composed of and led by individuals, but they come together to cooperate for a shared purpose.
The common welfare of the population, as opposed to an individual's selfish interests, is to be desired when operating a government responsible to and for the entire population.  
<!-- It's essential for a society to have a fair and impartial government, so that individuals are free to act in their own interest and prosperity can be secured.-->

We believe the people of the United States of America desire to participate in a conversation with their fellow citizens about the form and operations of their government.

We allow commercial entities to mediate public conversations - (Facebook, Google, Fox News, Twitter, TikTok, ...) and as we recover from the COVID-19 pandemic we need connection, conversation and shared purpose to heal our souls and our nation.

A non-commercial communication platform can help support free, fair elections and good government.

Our platform facilitates small group (4-5 users) formation and operation through a simple text message interface - SMS, webpage, app, etc.

Campaign volunteers and AI agents participate to help with group formation and to moderate and guide conversations.   

Conversations are time-limited and are not publicly visible through the platform.

## The Rockchain
By writing a transaction history to public blockchains, political campaigns can sign blocks of transactions, publicly attesting to their validity.
The platform allows campaigns to also digitally sign the platform's transaction history writes.
The platform uses the ipfs filesystem to periodically dump transactions.

## ID resolution
An identity resolution API is provided.
The API allows campaigns to make use of data on the platform without providing raw access to the data itself.
This makes it possible for platform participants to buy, sell, and rent data and maintain privacy.

## Ad-buying
Campaign advertising can be purchased effectively through the platform.
Reporting to public blockchains and standard web is supported.

## Voting
We support publicly-signed shadow election voting, through which predictions and estimates of actual voting behavior can be calculated.
